## Purpose

The step function of ADR 0152 (D15): no goroutine, no I/O, no clock. Every
decision of the protocol is here; every effect leaves through `Ready`.
Durability is an input (`StorageDone`), and the replies that depend on a
write leave in `Ready.AfterSync`.

## Tests

The deterministic simulator (`sim_internal_test.go`), the constructed checks
and `TestMutationsAreCaught` (one mutation per cited bug, behind the
unexported `Config.mut`), and the linearizability checker with its negative
control (`lincheck_internal_test.go`).

## Do NOT

- Iterate a map where the order reaches a message: a run must stay a pure
  function of its seed.
- Acknowledge a snapshot install past its index (review H1,
  `mutSnapshotAckLastIndex`).
- Append, acknowledge or skip an entry kind `Known` refuses: report it in
  `Ready.Unsupported` (review M3).
- Admit a forwarded command without the bounds of a local one
  (`admitForward`, review M2).
